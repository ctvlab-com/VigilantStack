# Welcome to VigilantStack

**An Open-Source MSP/MSSP Framework**  
VigilantStack leverages free and open-source tools to deliver a secure, multi-tenant solution for managing cybersecurity operations. This project integrates powerful technologies to streamline automation, ticketing, and monitoring, making it accessible and scalable for Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs).

## Project Overview

VigilantStack combines these core technologies to build an effective and open-source-driven solution:

### **1. Tines (SOAR/Automation)**
Tines is a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform designed to automate repetitive security tasks and improve incident response efficiency.

- **Purpose**: Automate workflows for faster threat response.
- **Example Use Case**: Automatically triage alerts from Graylog and escalate them as tickets in Zammad.
